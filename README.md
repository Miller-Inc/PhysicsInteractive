# Physics Interactive Simulator
This is a simple physics simulator that implements the physics library from Miller Inc. This is the main testing project for different parts of the library. See the library source code [here](https://github.com/Miller-Inc/MillerInc.PhysicsEngine.git). 

## Features
- 2D Physics Simulation
- 3D Physics Simulation
- Collision Detection
- Collision Resolution
- Rigid Body Dynamics
- Particle Dynamics
- Force Generators
- And many other features that have yet to be developed or implemented

## Installation
To install the library, you can download the repository and add the library to your project. 
The library is written in C++ and is header-only, so you can include the library in your project by including the header files in your project.
Full instructions are located in the README.md file in the library repository.

## Usage
To use the library, you can include the header files in your project and use the classes and functions provided by the library.
